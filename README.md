# TicTacToeAI

Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI (doesn't actually learn, just a smart lil' machine)

Uses recursion, if statements, logic trees, and many, many methods
Counts your draws and losses. No need to count wins, trust me

---

# TicTacToeAI.java

Contains the main method
Prompts the user for their name
Creates an object with the player's name and starts the game

---

# GameCode.java

Contains all methods retaining to the AI
Will continuously prompt the user to make a move, the AI will respond, then repeat
Ends when either the AI wins or the board is full (draw)
Will keep count of draws and losses
Continues to prompt the user if they'd like to play again
